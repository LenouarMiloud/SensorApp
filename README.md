## Light Sensors

Light Sensors are photoelectric devices that convert light energy (photons) whether visible or infra-red light into an electrical (electrons) signal

A Light Sensor generates an output signal indicating the intensity of light by measuring the radiant energy that exists in a very narrow range of frequencies basically called “light”, and which ranges in frequency from “Infra-red” to “Visible” up to “Ultraviolet” light spectrum.

And in this application, when the phone is in a dark atmosphere, it makes a sound when it receives light, it works almost like an alarm
